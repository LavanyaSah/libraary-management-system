Hey Guys!!!
Its my first project using concept of OOOPs with python.
A basic library management system which stores and manages detalis of a library. And give two types of accesss in a library as a student member and as a factulty member.
It uses all the concepts of OOPs such a abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism.
